            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>VIAPets began with a simple yet heartfelt vision: to bring people and pets together in a unique way.
                    The shop’s founder, Bob Oldenuff, opened, in the year 2020 , first Pets as a specialized pet shop focused exclusively on animals, not food or accessories.
                    His love for animals and understanding of their impact on people's lives shaped his approach to business.
                     Bob’s goal was to create a place where people could come to find not just a pet, but a true companion.</p>
                     <p>After the success of the initial shop, Bob saw an opportunity to deepen this relationship. He noticed that many customers needed more than a place to buy pets; 
                        they sought a trusted, safe environment for their animals to stay when they were away. In response to this need, in the year 2023 Pets expanded to include a kennel, 
                        where pets could receive dedicated care from a passionate and experienced team. 
                        This transformation from a simple pet shop into a combined pet shop and kennel allowed ViaPets to offer comprehensive care for animals.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>Bob’s expansion wasn’t solely about business growth; it was a decision rooted in his desire to create a home-away-from-home for pets, where owners could feel confident
                     in the level of care and attention their pets would receive. This decision helped solidify ViaPets as a central part of the community, catering to both the daily needs 
                     and the longer-term care of pets, making it a trusted haven for animals and a beloved resource for pet owners.</p>
                     <p>With each step, ViaPets has become a beloved part of the community.
                      We are here for the animals and the people who love them. Our journey is one of compassion, care, and commitment to every paw that walks through our doors.</p>
